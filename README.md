This project focuses on building an AI-based solar panel inspection system using deep learning. A binary classification Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained to automatically detect whether a solar PV panel image is clean or has a defect. The defect category includes multiple real-world issues like dust, snow, bird droppings, and physical damage. This system enables automated fault detection, which is critical for improving solar plant efficiency, reducing downtime, and enabling predictive maintenance in renewable energy infrastructure.

✅ Key Highlights:

Designed and implemented a deep learning-based binary classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify defective vs. clean solar PV panels from image data.

Integrated five real-world fault types—dust accumulation, bird droppings, snow coverage, electrical faults, and physical damage—into a single 'Defect' category to enable robust and scalable fault detection.

Achieved up to 80% validation accuracy with model outputs providing confidence scores, supporting more informed decision-making in real-time solar panel inspection.

Demonstrated potential for AI-driven automated inspection workflows, significantly reducing manual monitoring efforts and enabling predictive maintenance in large-scale solar farms.
